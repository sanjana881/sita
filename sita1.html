<h1 style="font-size:40px;">Sweat your cycle out</h1>
<p>If you’re someone who menstruates, you’ve likely had days where your cycle has impacted your workout plans, or had questions about how and when you should exercise during your period.</p>
<p>While the most common question tends to focus on whether or not you should be working out during your period, research shows there’s more to it than that! Hormonal changes throughout your menstrual cycle can have a range of effects on energy levels and exercise performance, and particular forms of exercise may be better suited to each stage of your cycle.</p>
<h2 style="font-size:30px;">Workout during your periods</h2>
<p>It’s that time of the month — the menstrual phase. This is when you’re menstruating, or when you’re actually on your period. But what is actually happening during this time, and how can you best support your body? </p>
<h3>How should you exercise when you have your period?</h3>
<p>You may have heard mixed messages about how you should exercise, or if you should work out at all while menstruating. There is also some evidence to suggest regular ongoing exercise could help decrease dysmenorrhea, also known as period pain.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what you choose to do is up to you and how you feel. If you choose to exercise during your period and are feeling low in energy, it may be a good idea to reduce the intensity of your workouts. Want to stay active during your menstrual phase without doing anything too strenuous? Here are some suggestions.</p>
<h4>Relaxing yoga poses or stretching</h4>
<p>If a full, rigorous workout doesn’t feel right for you during this time, practicing some restorative yoga poses can be a great way to release tension and stress while calming your mind and body. Asanas such as child’s pose, reclined spinal twist, and cat-cow are all poses that can help to relieve tension in your lower back and pelvis.</p>
<h4>Walking or light cardio</h4>
<p>Walking is an incredibly beneficial form of exercise you can do at any stage of your cycle. If you’re used to running or power walking, it can be a good idea to reduce your cardio intensity during the menstrual phase by going for a gentle walk, or a slower-paced jog. If you don’t feel like walking, there are many other ways to have an active recovery day while on your period.</p>
<h4>Lighter strength training</h4>
<p>You can continue to do strength training during this phase, but it might be wise to reduce your weights. Due to increased fatigue, this phase is not the time to push yourself too hard — so try sticking to where you’re currently at or taking it easier than usual.</p>
<h2>Exercising during the follicular phase</h2>
<p>Your period is over — and you’re now in the follicular phase of your cycle. Let’s take a look at how you can best exercise during this time of the month.</p>
<h3>How should you exercise during the follicular phase?</h3>
<p>With increased energy, the follicular phase is a good time to challenge yourself or try new things in your exercise routine.</p>
<h4>High intensity interval training</h4>
<p>Whether High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) is already a regular part of your routine or it’s entirely new for you, HIIT workouts are a great way to exercise when your energy levels are high! HIIT is fast-paced, fun, and has the physical benefits of increasing your VO2max - a measure of aerobic fitness which refers to the maximum amount of oxygen your body can utilise during exercise.</p>
<h4>Boxing</h4>
<p>Looking for another great way to let out your energy and try something new? Give Monica's Boxing Fit Challenge a go for a high energy workout that will help to build overall full-body strength.</p>
<h4>Strength training</h4>
<p>The follicular phase is also the perfect time to push yourself a little more with your strength training. This could mean challenging yourself with heavier weights or trying push-ups on your toes instead of your knees. If you’re new to strength training, start with some bodyweight exercises to build your confidence and make the most out of this high energy phase.</p>
<h2>Workout during the ovulation phase</h2>
<p>Similar to the follicular phase, ovulation tends to be a higher energy time. If that’s the case, you can make the most of this by getting some high-energy workouts in.</p>
<h3>How should you exercise during the ovulation phase?</h3>
<p>or the most part, you can continue to do the same high-intensity exercises you were doing during the follicular phase, or even switch up the style of cardio you do. If you usually cycle, could try running, or if you've been doing Tabata-style HIIT, why not mix it up and try circuit training instead? </p>
<h2>Workout during the luteal phase</h2>
<p>During the first part of this phase, you’ll likely still have energy from ovulating, which will decrease the closer you get to menstruation.</p>
<p>The luteal phase is characterised by a peak in progesterone levels — which can make some people feel drowsy. One 2003 review of research by the University of Sydney in Australia, published in Sports Medicine, suggested that for women doing endurance training, the mid-luteal phase is associated with increased cardiovascular strain and decreased time to exhaustion in hot conditions, most likely due to an increase in body temperature at this part of the cycle. This is a consideration for women undertaking endurance training or planning races, particularly in hot, humid conditions.

    Impaired running performance caused by an increase in core body temperature during the luteal phase was also observed by a small 2020 study, published in the Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness by St Mary's University in the UK. This does not mean that you shouldn’t run or exercise during this phase, but it may feel more difficult than other phases of your cycle.</p>
<h3>How should you exercise during the luteal phase?</h3>
<p>During the luteal phase, you can continue with your usual workout routine, but you may find it difficult to complete each session with your usual intensity. Here are some exercises you might like to try during the luteal phase of your menstrual cycle.</p>
<h4>Yoga or Pilates</h4>
<p>During the luteal phase when you are about to get your period and energy levels may be lower, this is a great time to practice yoga or Pilates — both of which gently increase overall strength while also releasing muscle tension. If you’re new to yoga, start with this guide to yoga for beginners.</p>    
<h4>Low-intensity cardio</h4>
<p>In the same 2019 study, aerobic exercise was also found to be beneficial for relieving PMS symptoms when performed three times a week for 12 weeks. During the luteal phase, you may like to try low-intensity cardio training: this could be going for a long walk, swim or bike ride.</p>
<p>Although more research is needed, the findings suggest pushing yourself to your absolute maximum cardio effort for a sustained period of time might not be possible during this phase. Try opting for low-intensity aerobic exercise instead or recognise it might not be your best workout!</p>
